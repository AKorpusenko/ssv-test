<h1 align="center">SSV: distributed staking ecosystem for Ethereum</h1>

<p align="center">
A decentralized, trust-minimized and scalable protocol that empowers Ethereum validators<br/>
to break beyond the constraints of a single node and flourish across a vibrant network of interconnected parties.

## Repositories

- üîë [ssv-keys](https://github.com/bloxapp/ssv-keys): CLI to break apart a validator's private key into a set of shares to be held by different operators.
- üìú [ssv-network](https://github.com/bloxapp/ssv-network/): smart contracts which onboard validators, operators and their shares.
- ‚öôÔ∏è [ssv](https://github.com/bloxapp/ssv) (this repo): p2p node which operators run to participate in the network and coordinate to perform the duties for their validators. Governed by [QBFT](https://entethalliance.github.io/client-spec/qbft_spec.html).

## Solo vs. Centralized vs. SSV

| Scenario | Solo | Centralized | SSV |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Hardware/network failure | ‚ùå Single machine | ‚ö†Ô∏è Opaque | ‚úÖ 3+ machines |
| Liveness failure in 1 of the clients | ‚ùå Single client | ‚ö†Ô∏è Opaque | ‚úÖ 3+ clients |
| Slashing protection failure | ‚ö†Ô∏è Single signer | ‚ö†Ô∏è Opaque | ‚úÖ 3+ signers |
| Setup complexity | ‚òÖ Hard | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ Easy | ‚òÖ‚òÖ Reasonable |

## Getting Started

Choose your path!

### ‚öî Become an Operator
Operators 

Join the network by [installing an SSV node](https://docs.ssv.network/run-a-node/operator-node/installation) and [registering as an operator](https://docs.ssv.network/run-a-node/operator-node/joining-the-network).

### üèπ Become a Liquidator

Liquidators run a special node that scouts for out-of-balance validators and liquidates them. [Get started here](https://docs.ssv.network/run-a-node/liquidator-node).

### üõ†Ô∏è Build on SSV
Anyone can register a distributed validator via the smart contracts. [Get started here](https://docs.ssv.network/developers/get-started).
